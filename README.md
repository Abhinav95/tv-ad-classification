# Television Advertisement Classification

This repository is a part of a Google Summer of Code project for Red Hen Lab / CCExtractor

Red Hen has an existing visual feature based classification and labeling system for news videos, but TV commercials are not considered by the pipeline so far. I want to add a multimodal TV commercial classification system to the pipelineâ€™s current capabilities.

This classification of commercials will be into multiple categories:-
* 01_alcoholic-drinks-tobacco/
* 02_automotive/
* 03_business-equipment-services/
* 04_consumer-public-services/
* 05_culture-leisure-sport/
* 06_fast-food-outlets-restaurants/
* 07_health-pharmaceuticals/
* 08_household-maintenance-pet-products/
* 09_industrial-agriculture/
* 10_non-alcoholic-drinks/
* 11_publishing-media/
* 12_transport-travel-tourism/
* 13_apparel-clothing-footwear/
* 14_banking/
* 15_confectionery-snacks/
* 16_cosmetics-beauty-products/
* 17_dairy-products-eggs/
* 18_grocery-other-foods/
* 19_home-electronics-home-appliances/
* 20_hygiene-personal-care-products/
* 21_internet/
* 22_public-awareness/
* 23_retail-distribution-rental-companies/
